🚀 FastAPI Backend Engineering Bootcamp
14-Day Structured Learning Path (Beginner → Backend Engineer)

This repository documents my 14-day FastAPI backend engineering journey, designed to simulate real backend development workflows.
Each day contains hands-on API development, debugging, documentation, and improvements — similar to how backend engineers work in real companies.
